# Memory Management Simulator

Welcome to the Memory Management Simulator repository! Here, you'll find a web-based simulator that allows you to play around with memory allocation algorithms. We've got three popular methods for you to explore: Best Fit, Worst Fit, and First Fit. So let's dive in and see how memory allocation works!



## Introduction

Managing memory is a big deal in the world of computers, and different algorithms have been developed to allocate and deallocate memory efficiently. Our simulator is here to help you understand and compare the performance of these algorithms. You'll get a chance to visualize how memory blocks are allocated and experiment with different settings to see the strengths and weaknesses of each method.
## Features

* Interactive Interface: We've created a user-friendly web interface that lets you simulate memory allocation algorithms with ease.

* Visual Representation: See memory blocks in action! The simulator provides visual representations of the allocation process, making it easier to understand what's going on.

* Customizable Settings: Adjust block sizes, memory size, and allocation patterns to fit your needs and experiment with various scenarios.

* Real-time Statistics: Keep an eye on the numbers! The simulator provides real-time statistics and analysis of each algorithm's performance.

* Easy-to-use: Our interface is designed to be intuitive, so you won't get lost. Clear instructions will guide you through the simulation process.

### BestFit
 
In the Best Fit algorithm, the memory blocks are allocated to the smallest possible block that can accommodate the requested size. This method aims to minimize fragmentation and utilize memory efficiently.

### First Fit

Worst Fit, on the other hand, allocates memory blocks to the largest available block that can hold the requested size. This method is known for creating more fragmentation but may be useful when large blocks are expected.

### Worst Fit

First Fit simply allocates memory to the first available block that can accommodate the requested size. It's a straightforward method that reduces searching time but may lead to higher fragmentation.
